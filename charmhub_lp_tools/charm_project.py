class CharmProject:
    """Represents a CharmProject.

    The CharmProject is defined in a yaml file and has the following form:

    - name: the human friendly name of the project
    - charmhub: the charmhub store name
    - launchpad: the launchpad project name
    - team: the team who should own the branches and charm recipes
    - repo: a URL to the upstream repository to be mirrored in launchpad
    - branches: a list of branch -> recipe_info mappings for charm recipes on
      launchpad.

    The branch_info dictionary consists of the following keys:

      * channels (optional) - a list of fully qualified channel names to
          publish the charm to after building.
      * build-path (optional) - subdirectory within the branch containing
          metadata.yaml
      * recipe-name (optional) - A string used to format the name of the
          recipe. The project name will be passed as 'project', the branch
          name will be passed as 'branch', and the track name will be passed
          as 'track'. The default recipe-name is '{project}.{branch}.{track}'.
      * auto-build (optional) - a boolean indicating whether to automatically
          build the charm when the branch changes. Default value is True.
      * upload (optional) - a boolean indicating whether to upload to the store
          after a charm is built. Default value is True.
      * build-channels (optional) - a dictionary indicating which channels
          should be used by the launchpad builder for building charms. The
          key is the name of the snap or base and the value is the full
          channel identifier (e.g. latest/edge). Currently, Launchpad accepts
          the following keys: charmcraft, core, core18, core20 and core22.
      * bases (optional) - a list of bases (e.g. "18.04", "20.04") that should
          be present in the channels.  Note that this can be different to the
          charmcraft.yaml 'run-on' bases as it may allow for custom bases.
      * duplicate-channels (optional) - a list of bases which are duplicates of
          this channel. i.e. if the charm is to be provided to both the train
          and rocky channels, the this would be added to the train channel,
          with rocky as the duplicate assuming the the train branch/channel is
          the source for the charm.

    The following examples provide information for various scenarios.

    The following example uses all launchpad builder charm_recipe defaults
    publishes the main branch to the latest/edge channel and the stable
    branch to the latest/stable channel:

    .. code:: yaml

      name: Awesome Charm
      charmhub: awesome
      launchpad: charm-awesome

      branches:
        main:
          channels: latest/edge
        stable:
          channels: latest/stable

    The following example builds a charm using the latest/edge channel of
    charmcraft, and does not upload the results to the store

    .. code:: yaml

      name: Awesome Charm
      charmhub: awesome
      launchpad: charm-awesome
      team: awesome-charmers

        main:
          store-upload: False
          build-channels:
            charmcraft: latest/edge

    The following example builds a charm on the main branch of the git
    repository and publishes the results to the yoga/edge and latest/edge
    channels and builds a charm on the stable/xena branch of the git
    repository and publishes the results to xena/edge.

    .. code: yaml

      name: Awesome Charm
      charmhub: awesome
      launchpad: charm-awesome
      team: awesome-charmers
      repo: https://github.com/canonical/charm-awesome-operator

            - latest/edge
        stable/xena:
          channels:
            - xena/edge


    The follow example builds a charm on the main branch of the git repository
    and publishes the resutls to the yoga/edge and latest/edge channels, builds
    the charm on the stable/xena branch and publishes the results to the
    xena/edge channel.  Additionally, the xena/edge channel is restricted to
    the 20.04 base, and any operations on the xena channel are duplicated to
    the victoria channel (e.g. copy, clean)
